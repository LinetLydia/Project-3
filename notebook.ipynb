    "SyriaTel faces challenges with customer churn, where customers stop using their services. The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their usage patterns, contact details and other relevant factors. The primary stakeholders are SyriaTel's management team, marketing department and customer retention team, who are responsible for understanding customer behavior and implementing strategies to retain customers. By identifying at risk customers early, SyriaTel can take proactive measures such as personalized offers, improved customer service or loyalty programs to reduce churn, enhance customer satisfaction and increase revenue."
